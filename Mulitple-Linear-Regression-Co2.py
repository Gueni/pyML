# #### Creating train and test dataset
# Train/Test Split involves splitting the dataset into training and testing sets respectively, which are mutually exclusive. After which, you train with the training set and test with the testing set. 
# This will provide a more accurate evaluation on out-of-sample accuracy because the testing dataset is not part of the dataset that have been used to train the data. It is more realistic for real world problems.

# This means that we know the outcome of each data point in this dataset, making it great to test with! And since this data has not been used to train the model, the model has no knowledge of the outcome of these data points. So, in essence, itâ€™s truly an out-of-sample testing.

#Multiple Regression Model

# In reality, there are multiple variables that predict the Co2emission. 
# When more than one independent variable is present, the process is called 
# multiple linear regression. For example, predicting co2emission using 
# FUELCONSUMPTION_COMB, EngineSize and Cylinders of cars. The good thing 
# here is that Multiple 
# linear regression is the extension of simple linear regression model.
